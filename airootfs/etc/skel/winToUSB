Check what device your USB media is assigned - here we will assume it is /dev/sdb. Delete all partitions, create a new one taking up all the space, set type to NTFS (7), and remember to set it bootable:

# cfdisk /dev/sdb   or   fdisk /dev/sdb (partition type 7, and bootable flag)

Create an NTFS filesystem:

# mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/sdb1

Write Windows 7 MBR on the USB stick (also works for windows 8), multiple options here:

# ms-sys -7 /dev/sdb
or (e.g. on newer Ubuntu installs) sudo lilo -M  /dev/sdb mbr (info)
or (if syslinux is installed) sudo dd if=/usr/lib/syslinux/bios/mbr.bin of=/dev/sdb
Mount ISO and USB media:

# mount -o loop win7.iso /mnt/iso
# mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb
Copy over all files:

# cp -r /mnt/iso/* /mnt/usb/   ...or use the standard GUI file-browser of your system

Call sync to make sure all files are written.

...and you're done.

After all that, you probably want to back up your USB media for further installations and get rid of the ISO file... Just use dd: # dd if=/dev/sdb of=/win7.img

and reverse if/of next time you want to put the Windows 7 installer onto USB.
